*Venus Fantasy Terraforming Stack*

This document lists **contextual, scientific, and project-internal references**
used to ground the analysis, assumptions, and boundary conditions of the fantasy
terraforming stack.

References are provided for **orientation and attribution**, not validation of
feasibility.

## Venus Cooling Project — Internal Repositories

These repositories form the analytical backbone that this fantasy stack builds
upon, contradicts, or selectively bypasses.

- **Space Straw** — Atmospheric venting limits and gas flow constraints  
- **Laser Cooling Venus** — Radiative transfer limits in dense atmospheres  
- **Europa Collision** — Failure modes of water-based cooling at planetary scale  
- **Teleportation Atmospheric Redistribution** — Scale analysis under physics-breaking assumptions  
- **Cosmic Blast** — Inefficiency of impulsive energy interventions  
- **Venus Space Radiators** — Heat rejection limits and infrastructure scale  
- **Hungry Powder** — Chemical fantasy pressure reduction and mass handling  
- **Current Best Known Solutions** — Grounded consensus and realistic bounds  

These works collectively establish why no single mechanism can dominate Venus’s
climate and why system coupling is unavoidable.

- Taylor, F. W. *Planetary Atmospheres*  
- Seiff et al., “Models of the Structure of the Atmosphere of Venus from the
  Surface to 100 Kilometers Altitude”  
- Ingersoll, A. P., “The Atmospheres of Venus and Mars”  
- Bullock & Grinspoon, *Climate Evolution of Venus*  
- NASA Venus Fact Sheet

These sources inform baseline properties such as pressure, composition, solar
flux, and radiative behavior.

- Pierrehumbert, *Principles of Planetary Climate*  
- Kasting, “Runaway and Moist Greenhouse Atmospheres”  
- Wordsworth & Pierrehumbert, “Hydrogen-Nitrogen Greenhouse Warming”  

Used to establish why pressure and optical depth dominate Venusian climate.

## Speculative and Boundary Analysis

- Dyson, “Interstellar Transport”  
- Ćirković, *Macroengineering and the Future of Humanity*  
- Badescu et al., *Mars and Venus: Atmospheres, Climate, and Habitability*  

These works provide historical context for large-scale planetary engineering
thought experiments.

## Fictional Elements

The following elements are **entirely fictional** and have no real-world
analogues:

- Hungry Powder (HP / NHP)  
- Cost-free teleportation of bulk matter  
- Perfect atmospheric mass removal without energy cost  

They are included to isolate scale behavior, not to suggest mechanisms.

## Citation Philosophy

This repository does not attempt exhaustive citation.

References are chosen to:
- anchor intuition  
- demonstrate awareness of existing work  
- prevent re-derivation of known failures  

If a concept appears without citation, it should be assumed to be:
- speculative  
- illustrative  
- or internal to the Venus Cooling Project

## Key Takeaway

The fantasy stack stands on top of real science **by intentionally stepping
beyond it**.

These references exist to show where the boundary is—and how quickly Venus pushes
back once you cross it.
