# Assumptions  
*Venus Fantasy Terraforming Stack*

This document enumerates the **explicit assumptions** required for the fantasy
terraforming stack to function as a closed system. These assumptions are not
arguments. They are **givens**.

If any assumption below is rejected, the stack collapses and the scenario
reverts to known Venusian failure modes.

## Classification

This repository is classified as **Fantasy** within the Venus Cooling Project.

All assumptions are intentionally optimistic, selectively non-physical, and
designed to remove dominant blockers so that downstream system behavior can be
examined in isolation.

## Primary Assumption (Gatekeeper)

### A1 — Successful Atmospheric Pressure Reduction

Atmospheric pressure on :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} is reduced from
~92 bar to near-terrestrial levels via Hungry Powder (HP / NHP).

This process:
- removes atmospheric mass without heat release  
- does not require energy input  
- does not impart momentum  
- does not destabilize the crust or mantle  
- does not trigger secondary greenhouse effects  

This assumption is **absolute**.  
No fallback mechanism exists.

---

## Material and Chemistry Assumptions

### A2 — Hungry Powder Properties

Hungry Powder and Nitrogen Hungry Powder are assumed to:
- bind atmospheric gases irreversibly  
- remain chemically inert post-reaction  
- be non-toxic in solid form  
- dissolve in water without releasing heat  

In oxygen-rich environments, HP is assumed to precipitate into translucent
crystalline solids with bluish-to-purplish coloration.

These properties are fictional and chosen for narrative and system clarity.

---

### A3 — No Secondary Atmospheric Poisoning

The pressure-reduction process does **not** introduce:
- corrosive aerosols  
- runaway recombination chemistry  
- catalytic greenhouse byproducts  

Atmospheric composition post-reduction is assumed to be benign enough to permit
later water introduction.

---

## Energy and Thermal Assumptions

### A4 — Solar Shading Effectiveness

A space-based solar shade or spectral filter is assumed capable of:
- reducing net solar input to controllable levels  
- operating continuously and stably  
- avoiding orbital decay, fragmentation, or resonance effects  

The shade does not need to eliminate sunlight—only reduce it sufficiently to
prevent thermal rebound.

---

### A5 — Residual Heat Is Finite and Manageable

Venus’s residual atmospheric and crustal heat is assumed to be:
- large but not self-amplifying once pressure is reduced  
- slowly releasable without triggering runaway feedback  

Limited crust-coupled radiators are assumed capable of bleeding off a *small*
fraction of this heat over long timescales.

Radiators are supportive, not primary.

---

## Transport and Logistics Assumptions

### A6 — Teleportation of Bulk Matter

Teleportation is assumed to allow:
- relocation of large masses of water ice from Europa  
- zero energy cost  
- no momentum transfer  
- no tidal or orbital side effects  

Teleportation is treated as a **fictional transport primitive**, not a
technology.

---

### A7 — Water Introduction Timing

Water is introduced **only after**:
- pressure is reduced  
- solar input is throttled  

Water is not required to cool Venus globally. It is used for:
- surface cooling  
- chemical washdown  
- environmental normalization  

---

## Temporal Assumptions

### A8 — Long Timescales Are Acceptable

The stack operates over:
- centuries to millennia  
- without urgency  
- without biological or human presence requirements  

No assumption is made that Venus becomes rapidly habitable.

---

## Stability Assumptions

### A9 — No Hidden Feedback Traps

It is assumed that once:
- pressure is low  
- solar input is controlled  

Venus does not possess unknown feedback mechanisms that forcibly restore its
previous state.

This assumption is optimistic but necessary.

---

## What Is *Not* Assumed

The stack does **not** assume:
- Earth-like biospheres  
- rapid human colonization  
- economic feasibility  
- political coordination  
- technological plausibility  

---

## Summary

These assumptions are intentionally extreme.

They are chosen not to make Venus easy—but to make the remaining difficulties
*visible*.

If Venus remains hostile even under these conditions, then the obstacle is not
technology, but planetary-scale system behavior.

The rest of this repository explores those consequences.
