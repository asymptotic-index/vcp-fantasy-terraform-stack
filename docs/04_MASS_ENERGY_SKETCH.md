# Mass and Energy Sketch  
*Venus Fantasy Terraforming Stack*

This document provides a **coarse, order-of-magnitude sketch** of mass and energy
flows across the fantasy terraforming stack. It is not a full budget. Its purpose
is to show **which terms dominate**, which ones merely support stability, and why
the stack only closes if pressure reduction is granted.

Numbers are illustrative and rounded to emphasize scale relationships rather than
precision.

## Baseline Planetary Scales

Key reference quantities for Venus:

- Mean solar input absorbed: **~75 PW**  
- Atmospheric mass (CO₂-dominated): **~4.8 × 10²⁰ kg**  
- Surface pressure (current): **~92 bar**  
- Characteristic atmospheric heat content: **enormous but finite**  
- Crustal thermal inertia: **planetary-scale, slow-release**

These values define why Venus is resistant: **continuous heating + deep storage**.

## Phase 1 — Atmospheric Mass Removal (Fantasy)

**Mass affected:**
- CO₂ + trace gases removed: **~4–5 × 10²⁰ kg**

**Energy accounting (assumed):**
- No heat released  
- No work required against gravity  
- No momentum exchange  

This violates physics by design.  
Its sole purpose is to eliminate the *pressure term* from subsequent equations.

**System consequence:**
- Infrared opacity collapses  
- Emission altitudes drop  
- Radiative cooling becomes altitude-accessible

## Phase 2 — Solar Shading / Spectral Filtering

**Energy affected:**
- Incoming solar power reduced by a controlled fraction  
- Target regime: **net absorbed power ≈ radiated power**

No specific reduction percentage is mandated here. The requirement is qualitative:
solar input must be throttled until it no longer dominates residual heat loss.

**Key insight:**
> Cooling capacity is irrelevant until heating is capped.

---

## Phase 3 — Residual Heat Management (Radiators)

**Energy affected:**
- Small fraction of stored atmospheric + near-surface heat  
- Timescale: **centuries to millennia**

Radiators are not sized to counter solar input. They operate only after Phase 2
has reduced net heating to near zero.

**Order-of-magnitude role:**
- Bleed-off, not extraction  
- Memory erasure, not temperature control  

Even modest continuous power removal becomes meaningful once the dominant
forcing term is gone.

## Phase 4 — Water Introduction and Surface Conditioning

**Mass introduced:**
- Large quantities of H₂O ice (exact amount unspecified)  

**Energy effects:**
- Local cooling via melting and evaporation  
- Heat absorbed during phase changes  
- Redistribution of surface heat rather than removal  

Water is intentionally *not* used to cool Venus globally. Its mass is small
relative to planetary heat capacity and solar flux.

**Primary function:**
- Chemical washdown  
- Surface normalization  
- Residue transport

## Dominant vs Supporting Terms

| Category | Dominance |
|--------|----------|
| Atmospheric pressure | Dominant (removed by assumption) |
| Solar input | Dominant (must be throttled) |
| Stored heat | Secondary (manageable after control) |
| Water heat capacity | Minor |
| Radiator output | Minor but stabilizing |

## Why the Stack Closes (Only in Fantasy)

The system closes because:
1. The largest mass term (atmosphere) is removed without energy cost  
2. The largest power term (solar input) is throttled  
3. Remaining energy reservoirs are finite and slow  

If **any** of these conditions fail, Venus reverts to:
- reheating  
- pressure amplification  
- or greenhouse lock-in

## Key Takeaway

Venus is not difficult because it contains *too much heat*.

It is difficult because:
- heat arrives continuously  
- heat escapes poorly  
- and pressure amplifies both effects  

Remove pressure by magic, cap the Sun, and the remaining terms finally behave
like an engineering problem rather than a planetary trap.

This document exists to make that hierarchy visible.
