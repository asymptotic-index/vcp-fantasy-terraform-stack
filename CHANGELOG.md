# Changelog  
Venus Fantasy Terraforming Stack — Venus Cooling Project

---

## Versioning Scheme

This project uses a simplified semantic versioning model:

- **MAJOR** — Conceptual scope change or reframing of the fantasy premise  
- **MINOR** — New analytical coverage, stack layers, or comparative extensions  
- **PATCH** — Clarifications, corrections, formatting, or consistency cleanup  

---

## Change Log

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release
- Established explicit **Fantasy** classification and NOTICE framing
- Defined the “gold path” terraforming stack as a curated, dependency-ordered system
- Granted atmospheric pressure reduction as a single impossible assumption
- Integrated solar shading, limited radiative bleed-off, and late-stage water introduction
- Clarified Hungry Powder properties, washdown behavior, and crystalline residue outcomes
- Documented strict sequencing and dependency logic
- Sketched dominant mass and energy terms to illustrate scale hierarchy
- Enumerated primary failure modes even under optimistic assumptions
- Added visual and narrative notes to make system transitions legible
- Compiled references linking real physics boundaries to speculative analysis

---

## Notes

This repository uses fantasy as a **systems-analysis tool**, not a proposal.

Future updates may:
- refine assumptions or failure classifications  
- expand comparative links to other Venus Cooling Project repositories  
- improve clarity or narrative framing  

They will not alter the core conclusion:

> Even with magic, Venus is constrained by scale, order, and energy balance.
