# NOTICE

This repository is part of the **Venus Cooling Project**, a collection of
independent studies exploring real, theoretical, speculative, and intentionally
fantastical ideas related to planetary cooling and engineering.

The **Venus Fantasy Terraforming Stack** is explicitly classified as **Fantasy**.

It intentionally relies on assumptions that violate known physical limits,
including but not limited to:
- Conservation of energy
- Conservation of momentum
- Material realism and chemistry limits
- Practical heat transfer and mass-handling constraints

These violations are not accidental. They are introduced deliberately to grant
one impossible capability—successful large-scale atmospheric pressure
reduction—and to examine what additional systems are still required to stabilize
Venus once that dominant constraint is removed.

Hungry Powder, teleportation of bulk water ice, and other non-physical mechanisms
are treated as fictional tools. No attempt is made to justify or derive them
within known science.

Despite these allowances, the project remains **system-disciplined**. Energy
flows, thermal inertia, sequencing, and dependency ordering are still enforced
to demonstrate that even fantasy-grade interventions must obey planetary-scale
system logic.

No claim is made regarding feasibility, desirability, safety, or originality.
This work is not a proposal for technology, experimentation, or action.

Authorship applies to the **structure, framing, integration, and presentation**
of this material as an educational and comparative thought experiment.

This repository exists to make one point explicit:

> Even if pressure is solved by magic,  
> Venus still resists you.

If you reference or build upon this material, attribution to the project or
